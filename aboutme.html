            <p style="text-align:left; padding-left:1em; padding-right:1em"> Hello there my name is Andriani, I am student at the University of South Carolina! I am majoring in Computer Science. I started coding in my first semester of
                college with little to no prior experience. I started learning Java at the beginning of the semester and dabbled very minimally in HTML and CSS. I looked into
                learning C++ but then put it on hold due to me taking Software Engineering at the beginning of Summer. Currently I'm working on different projects to create myself
                a portfolio, and this is one of them. Creating this website is allowing me to learn and develop my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and later JS. 
                <br><br>
                After I am done with my summer classes I will be working as a developer for a Grand Theft Auto V server. The server has roughly 29,000+ unique
                monthly players. I will be creating there website as well as developing in-game content using LUA.

                Yes, that is a two and half foot alpaca. I enjoy driving around Columbia in my Miata with a giant stuffed animal because it makes a lot of people smile and laugh so I enjoy it. I am
                currently trying to buy new parts for my Miata and have a little project to work on. I started getting into cars because of older brother who previously owned an

               He would drive me to school and getting out on the left side of the car would make so many people stare and ask questions. My brother would then go on to sell his car and buy himself a Miata, 
               then it so happens that the next week my brother spots another Miata for sale and decides to buy it for me with the help of my dad. This catapulted me into learning about cars, and devoting
               a lot of energy into learning how to drive a manual car. Now after learning how to drive this car, I want to modify it and give it it's own personality that sets it apart from other Miatas on the road
               meanwhile giving the alpaca an enjoyable experience.
