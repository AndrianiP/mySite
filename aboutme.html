            Hello there my name is Andriani, I am student at the University of South Carolina! I am majoring in Computer Science. I started coding in my first semester of
            college with little to no prior experience. I started learning Java at the beginning of the semester and dabbled very minimally in HTML and CSS. I looked into
            learning C++ but then put it on hold due to me taking Software Engineering at the beginning of Summer. Currently I'm working on different projects to create myself
            a portfolio, and this is one of them. Creating this website is allowing me to learn and develop my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and later JS. 
            <br>
            <br>
            After I am done with my summer classes I will be working as a developer for a Grand Theft Auto V server. The server has roughly 29,000+ unique
            monthly players. I will be creating there website as well as developing in-game content using LUA. During the Summer of 2022 I have an internship
